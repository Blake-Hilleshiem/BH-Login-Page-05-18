<!--
Build a Login Page with Basic HTML and CSS:

Do your best to replicate this design:
https://login-page-exercise.ryancurtis1.repl.co/

You should have:
 - A navbar with a background color
   - Some text in the navbar (non-functional is fine)
 - A page where a large image takes up the left half, and
   the login form is centered on the right
 - The login form should include a large header, email field,
   password field, and a submit button. Make this actually
   submit to https://httpbin.org/post. Your fields should be
   the appropriate types, and required before submitting.
 - Include 2 icons from fontawesome.
 - Import at least 1 font from google fonts.
 - Have a default font for the whole page, and then use a
   different font for your login header.

Try your hand at styling the form elements, but don't spend to much time on that if you can't figure it out.

Push to github and submit your link to me.

HAVE FUN!!!!!
